A simple URL (and open source) link shortener application using MongoDB and Node.JS, utilizing frontend framework using [**Tailwind**](https://tailwindcss.com/). I created this project out of boredom, and it took a few hours to construct.

## Prerequisites
- A MongoDB account with a database (this is used to store shortened link IDs)
- Node.JS w/ NPM
- Nodemon ```npm install -g nodemon```

## Setup

First, clone the repo using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imEdra/shrtn.ninja
```

After that, run ```npm install``` in the cloned directory

Go into index.js and replace ```"Your mongoDB link here"``` with your own URL from mongoDB.

Start the application using ```npm start```
Your website should be live on localhost:8000.
